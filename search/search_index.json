Basic C++ Programming In this chapter, we evolve a small program to exercise the fundamental components of the C++ language, These components consist of the following: A small set of data types: Boolean, character, integer, and floating point. A set of arithmetic, relational, and logical operators to manipulate these types. These include not only the usual suspects, such as addition, equality, less than and assignment, but also the less conventional increment, conditional and compound assignment operators. A set of conditional branch and looping statements, such as the if statement and while loop, to alter the control flow of our program. A small number of compound types, such as a pointer and an array. These allow us, respectively, to refer indirectly to an existing object and to define a collection of elements of a single type. A standard library of common programming abstractions, such as a string and a vector. 1.1 How to Write a C++ Program We start in the same place every C++ program starts - in a function called main(). main() is a user-implemented function of the following general form: int main() { // our program code goes here } Chapter 2.

How does Ellen feel? 31.mp3 Marilyn Ellen, I'd like your opinion Ellen About what? Marilyn Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming we need to have our own place to live. Ellen Oh. Marilyn Well, what do you think about Richard and me looking for a small house or an apartmnt at this point in our lives? Ellen We love having you here, and there is room, and...and when the baby comes, the baby can stay in your room for a while. Marilyn Richard feels we need to find a small house. Ellen I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa. Philip was a young doctor, and he kept talking about having a house of our own. It's natural. Marilyn What did you do ? Ellen We looked at a lot of houses. Marilyn Did you find one? Ellen Oh, not at first. We couldn't afford it.Grandpa wanted to led us the money to buy one, but philip is too independent. He didn't want to borrow any money. Marilyn Sounds like Richard. Ellen They're all alike. Richard is a real Stewart. He's independent, and sometimes just stubbom. Marilyn When did you buy a house? Ellen After Richard was born. I was teaching music,and Philip was opening his first meical office. Marilyn Where was the house? Ellen Right here in Riverdate. Of course, it was a small house, but just right for us. Marilyn It's funny. History repeats itself. Now Richard and I are having a baby, and we prbably won't be able to afford a house right away, either. Ellen Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn? Marilyn Good idea. Ellen Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times. You'll learn a lot. Marilyn Maybe we should speak to a real-estate agent about a house. Ellen And a bank about a mortgage. Marilyn I'll talk to Richard about it. I think it's a good idea, Ellen. We can learn a lot by asking. Ellen And if I can be of any help, let me know. As a matter of fact, my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent. Marilyn Good. Ellen You won't believe this, but she sold us our first house and this one. Marilyn Well, I'll tell Richard, and we'll go to see her. Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen? Do you think it's too long? Ellen I think the skirt is just right. Are you planning to attach a train to it? Marilyn No. No train. Just the dress. But I am going to make a headpiece of lace. Ellen That dress is gorgeous. Marilyn Thanks, Ellen. And thanks for the advice about the house. I'll talk to Richard about it the minute the comes home. Ellen And remember, we love having you here. There's no need to rush. Act II In Act Two, Marilyn and Richard speak with Mrs. Martinelli, a real-estate agent. Mrs. Martinelli offers to help. But she explains that Marilyn and Richard cannot afford a house in Riverdale. Will Marilyn and Richard find a house? 32.mp3 Virginia I remember your parents' first house very well. It was on Spring Avenue, near the park. Richard I grew up in that house. Virginia Yes, and you were such a cute baby. Marilyn I've seen pictures of him. He had blond hair. Virginia I've been friendly with the Stewart family for a long time, so It's my pleasure to help you find a house now. Richard Well, we're not sure we can afford one. Marilyn But we'd like to find ut about the possibileties. Virginia That's a good idea. I love your house on Linden Street. I sold your father that house seventeen years ago. Marilyn Really? Richard Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then, and they needed the extra room. Virginia I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs.Stewart. Marilyn Mmm-hmm. So we will be needing more room. Virginia Oh, so you don't need something immediately? Richard No. But in five or six months... Marilyn And time passes so quickly. Virginia Yes, it does. Well, when you called, you gave me enough information about your salaries and your savings. So I have a good idea about your financial situation. Let me show your some pictures of houses. Marilyn With two bedrooms? Virginia Yes, I think I can show you some. Of course, they won't be in Riverdale. The cost of housing's too high for you here. Richard I haven't thought about living anywhere else. We've always lived in this area. Marilyn Where should we look for a house, Mrs.Martinelli? Virginia Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco. It's a lovely area, and it's only about an hour's rive from here. Here. I have a book with photos of some homes in that area. Now, let's see. Here. This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range. Marilyn It's pretty, but I prefer a two-story home. Richard I do, too. I don't care for a ranch type. Virginia OK. Oh, this is a wonderful house. I know it well. I sold it to the present owners. Richard It looks wonderful. Virginia This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house. It has a full basement, and it is on a half- acre lot. You can probably afford this one. Marilyn I like this house. Richard So do I. Virginia And the price is right. Would you like to go see it? Richard Yes. We're planning to talk to someone at the bank next week. Perhaps we could see the house this weekend. Virginia If some one doesn't buy it before then. But let's keep looking. Just to get an idea of some other possibillties. Richard This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli. Virginia Here. This is a wounderful example of Spanish-style architecture. Richard Oh, I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house. Marilyn It looks like the houses in Hollywood. Virginia It's interesting. A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price. Oh my! Here's a real buy. It's a bargain. This house just came on the market. Marilyn It's quite lovely. Is it a two-bedroom house? Virginia No. It has three bedrooms and three baths. I know the house. It has a brand new kitchen. And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. And there's a two-car garage. Richard Then why don't we go look at this house, too? Virginia It's a good investment. Richard Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli. Marilyn Thanks so much. Virginia My pleasure. Give my best to your parents. Virginia Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard. He took care of my daughter when she was a child. He's the best pediatrician in Westchester. Richard Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli, I'll give them your regards. Marilyn We really appreciate your advice. Virginia I do think you should go see the houses and talk to the bank. Here. Let me give you some information sheets abo the houses. They're both very good buys. Richard Well, thanks so much for your help and your time, Mrs. Martinelli. We've got a lot to talk about. Marilyn Mmm-hmm. Thanks.

Richard We're talking about buying a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.Here are the financial details on the house. Mr.Riley Thank you. Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment? Richard Yes, we are. Mr.Riley Payments over thirty years? Richard Yes. Marilyn Do you think we can get a loan? Mr.Riley Well, it depends. Do you own any other property? Any stocks or bonds? Richard No. Mr.Riley I see. Then you don't have any collateral. Perhaps you could get a guarantor- someone to sign for the loan for you. Richard Why is that necessary? Mr.Riley Since you don't have enough income, and you don't already own any property, the bank needs to be sure you can pay the mortgage every month. A gauarntor is responsible for the loan if you can't make the payments. Richard I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting. Marilyn Thank you, Mr.Riley. We'll read this over carefully. Mr.Riley Thank you. Richard Good-bye. Thanks. Mr.Riley Godd-bye.And hope to see you soon. Richard I hope so, too. Mr.Riley Take care. Marilyn Good-bye. Richard It all sounded so easy until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor. Marilyn We have no collateral. Richard And I don't think it's a good idea to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor. I don't feel right about it. Marilyn I understand your feelings about it, Richard. Ellen Now, tell me, what's the problem? Marilyn We can get a loan from the bank if we can put up some collateral. Richard And we don't own anything to use as collateral. Marilyn Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor. Ellen Why don't you speak to Dad? Richard No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone. Ellen Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard. Marilyn I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen. Richard In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book and be able to put more money down. Marilyn What about the house in Mount Kisco? Somebody else'll buy it by then. Richard Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn. Ellen Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look. Marilyn We're in no great rush. It's true. Richard This has been a great learning experienc for us, Marilyn.Talking to the real-estate agent. Looking at the houses.Talking to the loan officer at the bank. Marilyn It has been a learning experience. That's true. Ellen I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.Looking around.Especially with a purchase of this kind.You're talking about a lot of money. Marilyn We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us. Richard And I'll call Mr.Riley at the bank and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months. Ellen And if you ever need Dad or me to help you... Marilyn We know. Ellen You know we'll be there for you. Richard It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family. Episode 12 - You're Tops Act I In the first act, Grandpa is restless. He is waiting for Susan to come over for dinner. Since Grandpa retired, he has too much free time. What does Grandpa want to do? 34.mp3 Grandpa Is that you, Susan? Susan It's me, Grandpa. Grandpa Am I glad to see you! Susan And am I glad to see you! I am also glad to be here. Grandpa How are things? Susan I have been talking to a group of salesmen since ten this morning, and I'm real exhausted. Grandpa Well, you look good. What's Harry doing tonight? Susan He and Michelle are visiting relatives in New Jersey today. Grandpa The rest of our family went to the movies. So it's just you and me, Susan. Susan It's nice to be alone with you, Grandpa. We don't get to see enough of each other. Grandpa Oh, I feel the same way, Susan. I miss seeing you. But to tell the truth, next time I'd like to go into the city and meet you there, instead of you coming here. Susan You don't need to do that, Grandpa. Grandpa Yeah, I do. I need to get out more. Well, I mean there's a lot to do around the house, and I love being here with the family, you know, but I'm restless. Since I retired, I've got extra time on my hands. Susan I understand, Grandpa. Grandpa I think you do. Frankly, I'd like to use my brain a little more. Susan Grandpa, you have so much energy and so many years of experience. There are probably a lot of places for you to work. Particularly in the construction field. Grandpa But at my age, I'm not looking for a full-time job. I'm retired. But I'm bored. Susan Well, there must be something. Maybe I can help. Grandpa Let's go into the kitchen, and maybe can help me set the table. Susan Sounds good to me. What are we having? Grandpa I prepared lamb chops, mashed potatoes, and a tossed green salad to begin with. Susan Grandpa, you are a terrific guy! Susan You're still thinking about something to do, aren't you? A job of some kind. Grandpa That's right. I've been thinking about it for weeks now .There must be some way to put my mind to good use. Susan We'll find a solution. A positive solution to your finding a way to use that wounderful mind of yours. Act II In the second act, Susan talks with Sam, her assistant, about her Grandfather's problem.

Sam You sound like something's brothering you, Susan. The sketches for the cover of the new doll book? Susan That's not it. Please sit down. Sam Sure. Susan I need your advice on a personal matter, but it's not about me. Sam You need my advice on a personal matter, and it's not about. OK. Susan It's about my grandfather. Sam What's the probem? Susan It won't sound like a big deal, but it is. I had dinner with him Saturday, and he's very unhappy about not working. Sam I thought he was retired and pleased to be living with the family. Susan He is, but there's so much energy and talent in the man ,and he doesn't get to use it. Sam But what can I do?What kind of advice are you looking for? Susan Simply this. John Marchetta runs this company. Sam He founded this company. Susan Right. John Marchetta Gave me my start here six years ago, when I first graduated from college. He gave me the chance to use my talents and made me feel more confident. Sam Right. Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather. Susan Or at least give him some advice. Sam Right. Then I've solved your problem. Susan I can always depend on you, Sam. Sam I'm glad to help. Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you? Susan No, no. I'll do that. Thanks. Sam Now, how's the Stewart family? Susan Fine, thank you, Mr. Marchetta. Except for my grandfather. Sam What's wrong, Susan?What's wrong with him? Susan He needs to work. In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you. I know you're building a new factory, and I thought...may be...my grandfather is so experienced in the construction trade, he could be so valuable. Sam Tell him to come and see me at ten 0'clock tomorrow morning. I have an idea that may solve the probem for him and help a lot of other people. Susan Really, Mr.Marchetta? Can I tell him that? Marchetta Sure can. Ten o'clock in the morning. Here. Susan Oh, thank you! Act III In the third act, Grandpa meets with John Marchetta. And Grandpa tells Mr. Marchetta about his experience in the construction business. And he explains his problem. So John Marchetta tells Grandpa about an organization called TOPS. How can TOPS help? 36.mp3 Grandpa Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart. Marchetta John Marchetta.Sit down, sit down. Grandpa Susan has told me a great deal about you.She says you're quite a man. Marchetta She says a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr.Stewart. Grandpa That's always nice to hear, Mr.Marchetta. Marchetta Call me John. May I call you Malcolm? Marchetta Let's talk business. Grandpa That's music to my ears. Marchetta I understand you used to be in the construction business. Grandpa Yup. Forty-three years. Here's a brief description of forty three years of on-the-job training. Marchetta That is some history! You're a valuable asset, Malcolm.Very valuable. Grandpa Thank you. Yup. Forty-three years. Half that time in my own construction company. Big jobs-factories, shopping malls.That kind of thing. Marchetta Then you retired. Grandpa Yes. After my wife died, and I felt I should spend more time with my children and grandchildren. I live in Florida, and they lived in New York. Marchetta I understand.My daughter Cami lives in NewYork. I like being near her. Grandpa When I came here, I planned to take a few months off. Relax with the family and then look for some work. Put my experience on the line...but, unfortunately, there isn't any work for a retired person my age. Marchetta Sometimes there is, and sometimes there isn't. Well, I'm mvolved with an organization, and we're trying to resolve that problem. Grandpa What's that? Marchetta TOPS.T -O-P-S- means Talented Older People's Society. Grandpa I'd like to be a member. How much are the dues? Marchetta There are no dues...The organization serves major men and women like you. Experienced, talented, retired.But our members want to go out there and use their talents.They want to work. Grandpa That fantastic, John! Marchetta I've got and idea for you, Malcolm. Just fill out this form for me. It'll only take a few minutes. Sit right here, and do it while I talk to my secretary. When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory. My company is a membe of TOPS. So I try hard to find opportunities for people like it. Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now. Have you got time this morning to go over to the construction site with me? I'd like to have you meet my foreman-get some background on the job. Grandpa I've got plenty of time. Marchetta I'll be right back. We'll go over to the job site together. Danny Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project? Grandpa My company was the contractor. I built the theater there with my own two hands, practically. Danny I understand. Marchrtta Well, I'm glad to see you two guys geeting along so well because Danny, Malcolm is on the TOPS team.He's going to be working with you for a while. His experience will be valuable to both of us. Danny Welcome aboard, Malcolm! Marchetta I'm going back to my office. Give me a call later, Malcolm. I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting. I'd like you to meet the group. Grandpa I will, John. And again-thanks. Marchetta No...thank you. And thank Susan. Grandpa He's quite a man. Danny A real inspiration for me. Grandpa OK, Danny. I know you didn't expect to have me around, but I think I can be of some help to you. Danny Let me tell you something, Malcolm. With your background and experience, I can learn something...and I do need some advice on a difficult problem.Let me show you this. Grandpa I don't want to give you a final opinion without studying these building plans more carefully. But a simple solution might be to move the air-conditioning units instead of redesigning the entire system. It might be simpler and less expensive. Danny You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm. Welcome aboard! Grandpa It all happended so quickly! I can't believe it! Susan I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful. Grandpa He was more than helpful. He actually took me to meet his foreman. Susan I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa. Grandpa I don't know how to thank you, Susan.You're a wonderful granddaughter. Susan It's good to see you so happy. Grandpa I'll be at the construction site tomorrow. What are you doing tomorrow night? Susan I'm not doing anything. Why? Grandpa How about a date with your grandfather? I owe you a good steak dinner. Susan I'll accept. Tomorrow night. You and me. Dinner. What time? Grandpa I'll pick you up here at seven. Is that OK? Susan I can't wait!

Susan Harry, I get it! Harry Well? Does that mean you'll marry me? Susan Is that a proposal, or are we just playing a game? Harry Sit down, Susan. There's something I have to ask you. Susan, will you marry me? Susan It's such an important decision .There's so many things to talk about. There are three things that have to be done first, Harry. Harry Three things? Susan First, we have to decide where to live. Harry Well, that's easy. We talked about that earlier. We'll live in New York. Susan All right.

Episode 18 - Making a Difference Act I In Act One, Ellen finds out that Carter Boswell is running for the school board. Ellen is upset because Boswell wants to cut the school cultural programs. Philip thinks Boswell will win the election. What will Ellen do? 52.mp3 Ellen I don't believe it! Philip What's wrong? Ellen Carter Boswell! Philip Who's Carter Boswell? Ellen He's running for the school board. The election's next month. Philip What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board? Ellen Nothing. But he wants to cut the school budget! Philip Maybe it needs cutting. Ellen Cutting the budget is fine, but he wants to do it by cutting all the cultural programs. No music, no dance, no concert, no stage presentations. Philip Why does he want to do that? Ellen He says it's to save the taxpayers' money, and I think he believes that the taxpayers' will vote for him if he spends less on the cultural programs. Philip He's probably right. Lots of reople want their taxes used for new books and a new paint job in the schoolrooms. Ellen Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more and keep the cultural programs for our kids. Philip Well, I'm not sure, Ellen. I hear it from my patients. Lots of people are tired of highter taxes. Ellen I know, but if Boswell wins he'll be an important decisionmaker on the school board, and he doesn't know anything about our children's education. Philip Who's running against him? Ellen Nobody. That's the problem. Philip Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell is going to win this seat on the board. Ellen Oh, not if I can stop him! Philip And how are you going to stop him? Ellen I don't know. Maybe I'll run against him. Philip Well, You've got my vote. Ellen I'm serious, Philip. Why shouldn't I run? Robbie Why shouldn't you run for what, Mom? Philip Your mother is thinking of running for the school board. Robbie Hey, that's terrific, Mom! Richard Against Carter Boswell? Great! Ellen Well, if I run for office, the voters will have a clear choice. I stand for everything Boswell doesn't. Marilyn I think a lot of people will vote for you against Boswell, Ellen. I'll vote for you. Ellen Will you help me if I do run? Marilyn Absoutely. Ellen The trouble is it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign. Philip I think you can make a difference, Ellen. And in a short campaign you wouldn't need as much money. You know something, Ellen? Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice? I'm with you. You can make a difference. Maxwell Come in. Ellen Mr.Maxwell? Maxwell Yes, Charles Maxwell. Ellen My name is Ellen Stewart. Maxwell Hello.Please, sit down. You asked to see me. What would you like to see me about? Ellen I'd like your help. Maxwell Well, I'm editor of the most influential newpaper in Riverdale. Actually, it's the only newspaper. A lot of people would like my help. Do you have a story? Ellen I'm planning to run for the school board. Maxwell Against Carter Boswell? Ellen Yes. Maxwell Well, that is news. Ellen Will you announce that I'm running? Maxwell Sure. But I need some information. Ellen Of course. Maxwell Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell, Mrs.Stewart? Ellen Because I care. Maxwell \"Vote for Ellen Stewart.She cares.\" Not a bad slogan. But what do you care about? Ellen Well, I care about the children of our town. I don't want hem to grow up without cultural programs in our school. Maxwell Do you have a plan? Ellen I want our children to learn more than reading, writing, and airthmetic. I want to keep the after-school programs-the music, the concerts. Maxwell It's not a bad plan. But who's going to pay for all of this? Ellen We are.The citizens of Riverdale, of course. I plan to get help from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale. Maxwell That's fair enough.Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs.Stewart? Ellen You don't know me. I can't expect you to take my side a against Boswell. But I do nee some publicity so that the people of our town know that I'm running for office and that I car about our children. Maxwell Fair enough. I certainly can print the news. And you are now making news. Act II In Act Two, everyone helps Ellen and her campaign. Grandpa gets the fliers printed. Marilyn and Richard prepared the envelopes. And Robbie and his friends tell people about Ellen's campaign. Later, the family sees Boswell in a commercial on television. What will Boswell say? 53.mp3 Grandpa Here are the fliers, hot of the press! Ellen Looks good.Simple. Marilyn Right over there, Grandpa. You fold the fliers, Richard and I will put them into the envelopes. Richard We finished addressing over three hundred envolopes. Grandpa Need another box? Ellen Good work, gang. Mike Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr.Or Mrs.Anderson? Thanks. Robbie Mr.Nelson. Hi. This is Robbie Stewart.Did you know my mother is running for the school board? Jimmy Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart.\"She cares.\" Oh, see you at the polls. Robbie Certainly, I'll give her your best wishes, Mr.Nelson. Mike Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

Marilyn Licking envelopes. Grandpa I fold the fliers. Richard We stuff them. Philip And I lick the envelopes. Robbie Hey, everybody, Mrs.Greenberg is on the phone. She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now-doing a commercial. Philip What channel? Robbie Five. Philip Five? Boswell ...and if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you. I care about the school buildings in need of paint. I care about more lockers for the teachers. I care about new fixtures in the hallways-not music or dancing or entertainment. I care about the practical things. If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell. Ellen A lot of people will agree with him. Philip I told you. Robbie Too bad kids can't vote. It's our school, but we can't vote. Richard There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom. Marilyn There are, Ellen. Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial. Philip You have to go on television, too. Ellen Boswell's a powerful speaker. Philip You can be, too. Your ideas are good ones. Ellen I don't know. I'm not sure I'm up to it. Act III In Act Three, Richard and Robbie make a video tape of Ellen as she gives her campaign speech. And Richard figures out a way for people to see the video tape. Later, the family listens to the election news. Will Ellen win the election? 54.mp3 Ellen ...my slogan is \"I care\". I care about people, not things, Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care. How was it? Richard You were terrific! Ellen Can I see it? Richard Sure. Ellen Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart, and I'm running for the open seat on the school board. My slogan is\"I care\". What does the word care mean?...I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care. Philip I like it, but now what? How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale will see it and hear it? Richard Leave it to me. Ellen ...I mean that when I say\"I care\". I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care. Marilyn What happened? Richard Mom is now on television in every appliance store in Riverdale, except Hamlin's.He's a Boswell voter. Philip That's a brilliant idea, Richard! Grandpa You inherited your father's brains. Philip We got our brains from you, Day. Richard And guess what? I called channel five. Their TV news is going to cover it.\"Housewife campaigns in appliance stores.\"And I'll bet some magazine will pick up the story, too. Robbie Mom, you're going to win! I know it! Philip Hold it, Robbie! Just cool down. Iknow we're getting some attention now, but in the end the voters will have to decide. Grandpa You're going to win. Trust me!

So was my night. It's almost ten 0'clock. Mmm.I'm starving. Um...where's Mom? Robbie She went to a school-board meeting. Grandpa There's a note for you on the refrigerator. Philip Oh? Philip Did you have dinner, Robbie? Robbie Yeah. Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner. I came home a little while ago. You've been working late almost every night this week, Dad. Aren't you exhausted? Philip I don't have time to be exhausted. Robbie You and Mom haven't had dinner together with us in almost a full week. Philip Yeah, I feel bad about us not having dinner with the family, but our schedules are so different. Either I'm at the hospital doing paperwork, or Mom is at a committee meeting. I frankly don't know what to do about it. Robbie I'm worried about you and Mom. You really have been working too hard. Philip Well, I think I've had enough of that sandwich. Robbie You didn't finish it. Philip It's not good to eat before going to bed. A cookie can't hurt, though. Philip Well, I'm heading off for bed and a good night's sleep. Robbie Well, good night. Philip Good night, son. Good night, Dad. I'm going to bed. Grandpa Good night, Philip. Philip Haven't you finished balancing that checkbook? Grandpa I found another mistake. I'll be off to bed myself in a minute. Philip OK.Good night. Robbie I'm really concerned about them, Grandpa. Grandpa Concerned about whom? Robbie About Mom and Dad. They hardly ever see each other. Dad often works late, and Mom has all these committees she's on.Grandpa: What do you propose to do about it? You have that look in your eye. Robbie I don't know, but there must be a way of getting them to spend more time together. Quality time. Act II In Act Two, Robbie tells Ellen how he feels. Robbie wants his parents to spend some time together. But Ellen knows that she and Philip are too busy to take a vacation. So Robbie tries again. What is Robbie's idea? 59.mp3 Ellen Hello there, Robbie. What are you doing up this late? Robbie Reading. Ellen Reading? At this hour? Ah, come on, Robbie. What are you doing up this late? Robbie Things on my mind. Ellen Do you care to talk about them? Robbie Sure, if you don't mind listening. Ellen Robbie, Robbie, remember me? I'm your mother. If you have something you want to talk about, I'm always prepared to listen. Robbie You haven't been around much lately. Ellen So that's it. OK, let's talk. Robbie You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night. Dad works hard, and he works late. You work hard on all your committees, and you work late. Ellen I thought you were pround of the work I do. Robbie I am, Mom. Real proud. You are one fantastic mom, but...but I've been noticing how little quality time you spend with Dad and me... and the family. Ellen It's a real problem, Robbie. I know it. Robbie I'm concerned. There must be a way that Day and you can spend mor time together. Ellen Well, we always talk about taking a vacation together with the family. Robbie I think you ought to take a vacation away from the family-alone. Kind of a second honeymoon. Ellen It would be wounderful, but our schedules won't allow it. Robbie I think I have an idea. Ellen You do? Robbie Yup. I think I have an idea that will bring Dad and you together in a more scheduled way. Ellen What is it? Robbie Well, you know how Dad is always talking about the kids in the ward and how important it is for them to be paid attention to? Ellen Yes. Robbie Well...and how hard it i because the doctors and murses are so busy? Ellen Yes. Robbie Well, how would it be if you took some time to work with Dad towards solving that problem? Ellen I don't get it. Robbie Like setting up a regular weekly reading program. You and Dad. You and Dr.Philip Stewart-going to the children's ward once or twice a week and reading to them. Ellen Not bad. Not a bad idea, Robbie. As a matter of fact, it fits right in with something I'm working on right now with the school-board committee. Robbie What's that? Ellen I've been trying to work out a program in the public school that will bring parents and teachers together once a week to read to the students-their own children, really. By doing that, it will enoourage reading. Robbie So it might fit in with a program for reading to the kids in the hospital. Ellen You're right. We'll do it! I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now. Robbie But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work. Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow? Ellen You are a very smart young man, Robbie. I think I'll wait until tomorrow. Robbie You won't forget, will you? Ellen Believe me, I won't. It is a great idea, and I promise you I won't forget. Robbie Thanks, Mom. Ellen Thank you, Robbie. Act III In Act Three, Ellen tells Philip about her project. Philip thinks the project would work in hospitals. So Ellen and Philip agree to work together. What will Ellen and Philip read to the children? 60.mp3 Ellen Good morning. What a wonderful morning! Don't the flowers smell wonderful? Philip Good mrning, Ellen. Yes, they do. That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee on the patio this morning. Ah, it does smell sweet. How was your school- board meeting last night? You must've come home very late. Ellen Did you find the sandwich I made for you? Philip Thanks, dear. I was so tired I didn't even finish it. Ellen Philip, I've been working on this special project with the school board, and I'd like your opinion about it. Philip What is it?Ellen: I've been trying to find a way to encourage reading. Philip Good luck! Ellen Well, I think I may have found a way to do it. Philip Tell me about it. I work with families every day, Ellen. I see how people spend their leisure time-young and old. Ellen Mostly watching television. Well, that would be OK if , and I repeat, if people took the time to read. Philip I couldn't agree with you more. Ellen The question is, how do we get them to read more? Philip I think you're going to give me the answer to tha question. You have that lookin your eye. Ellen I do have an answer, Philip. Or at least I think I do. Philip Well, tell me about it. Ellen The plan is a simple one. Involve the entire family in a reading project. Philip In the home? Ellen Yes, in the home. But first in the school-rooms. Philip Hmm, interesting. But how do you plan to do that? Ellen By arranging with the public schools to schedule one hour a week-to start with. During that time parents are invited to attend-and to read along with the children- their children. Philip It can go beyond the school system, Ellen. Ellen Readlly? Philip I guarantee you it would go very in the hospitals.My patients-mostly kids-would love to read and be read to. Ellen You think so? Philip I know so. Ellen May be we can experiment with your patients and see how the plan works. Philip I love the idea. Would you work with me? Ellen I would love to, Philip. Philip And that way, we'll spend more time together, Ellen. We just don't see each other anymore. Ellen You and I are very busy these days. This is true. We need to find time to be together more, to do things together more-you and I. This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that. Philip I have a question. Ellen Yes? Philip What do we read? Ellen To the patients in the ward? Philip Yes. Ellen Well, let you and I talk about it. What would you like to read to them? Philip Mrs. Setwart and I will read a poem by Robert Frost. Ellen It's called\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.\" Philip Would you begin, Ellen? Ellen All right. \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\"by Robert Frost. Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow. Philip My little horse must think it queer. To stop without a farm house near between the woods and frozen lake. The darkest evening of the year. Ellen He gives his hamess bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake. Ellen&Philip The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. Grandpa You two belong on stage! That was wonderful! Ellen Grandpa! Philip Dad...Robbie. When did you come? Grandpa We've been listening to you both. These are lucky kids. Robbie Do you enjoy reading together? Philip Well, we may read together aloud at home. Grandpa You were right, Robbie. Robbie I know.

Marilyn No, that's OK. I'll do it. Act II In the second act, Ellen tries to help Marilyn. And Marilyn wants to know what Ellen decided to do when her children were babies. Later on, Susan tells Marilyn what her life is like as a working mother. What will Marilyn decide to do? 65.mp3 Ellen There's your teddy bear, Max. Ellen He just loves that teddy bear that Grandpa Philip bought for him. Marilyn I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a checkup. You should have seen the look on his face when Molly gave him the injection. Ellen Oh, did he cry? Marilyn No, My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say, \"Mama, what are they doing to me?Help!\" Ellen How did you feel? Tell the truth didn't you feel terrible? Marilyn I sure did. I held him closely. I kissed the top of his dear little head. He looked up at me. He tried to smile. Being with him helped. Ellen Helped him? Or helped you? Marilyn Being a mother is not easy, if that's what you mean. Ellen Speaking of being a mother, I've been meaning to ask you what you were thinking about regarding going back to work. I know Rita Mae called. I can imagine what is going through your head. Marilyn I'm sure you can, Ellen. Ellen There are so many things to consider. One thing that makes it easier for you is that you have us. Max will always have a family member to watch over him while you're at work. I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born. Marilyn What did you do? Ellen I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher. We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan, and I continued with my career. Marilyn Do you think you made the right decision? Ellen I think I did. But when Ribbie was born, I decided to give fulltime attention to raising Robbie. I felt differently at that time. Marilyn And you gave up your career as a music teacher? Ellen Not exactly. I continued to teach piano lessons at home. Marilyn How did you feel about being away when Susan and Ricard were babies? Ellen I think I did the right thing for them and for myself and for Philip. We needed the money. Remember? Marilyn Well, we do too, Ellen. Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house we want and need. Susan I can't wait till he's just a little older. Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids. Marilyn Max thanks you. I thank you. And Ricard thanks you. Now may I please say hello? Susan Hello. Hello. I miss Max and think about him all week long. We talk about him at dinner time. Ellen Will you please try to relax? I've never seen you so wound up. Marilyn You seem to be enjoying the pressure. Susan The truth is, I am. My job is not an easy one, but I really enjoy it. Marilyn That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan. Susan What's the problem? Ellen Marilyn's career. Marilyn Well, my choice of careers. Susan Choice? Marilyn My career as a fashion desinger versus my career as a mother. Susan Why does it have to be one or the other? Ellen That's what I said. Marilyn How's that? Susan Why can't you do both? Ellen She's right. Marilyn Both? Susan Well, that's what I do. I have a job, and I have Michelle. I take care of both to the best of my ability. It's not easy, but what is? Ellen And that's what I did. I did both with Richard and Susan, and I did both with Robbie. Marilyn I thought you stayed home with Robbie? Ellen I did. But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher which I could continue at home. Susan Why can't you work at home, Marilyn? You're very talented. Designing dresses is a career you could establish out of your home, couldn't you? Marilyn I don't know why I didn't think of it. It seems so simple now.for a year or two I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs. Ellen And you could make your dresses at home. Susan Sounds like a great way to solve the problem. Ellen That could solve your problem, Marilyn. Marilyn I'm going to call rita Mae at home and ask her come by and talk about it. She want to see Max, anyway. Susan I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn. You can do it.Do your designs at home-here. Marilyn And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique. Ellen And you can both benefit financially. Marilyn I'm going to call Rita Mae right now. Oh, Susan, thank you so much for coming all this way form the city to talk to me about it. I hope you don't mind having taken so much time away from your busy schedue. Susan Are you kidding? I don't mind at all. As a matter of fact, I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew. Ellen I think you should call Rita Mae right now. I think your idea of working at home is perfect. Marilyn I don't know what I would do without you. I'm lucky to have you all. Ellen We are lucky to have you, Marilyn. Susan And so is Max. Act III In the third act, Marilyn tells Rita Mae about her decision to stay at home with Max. Rita Mae isn't happy with the decision, of course. But then Marilyn tells Rita Mae about her plans to design wedding dresses at home. What will she think of the idea? 66.mp3 Ellen Hi, big guy. Marilyn That must be Rita Mae. Ellen She sure got here quickly. That's a good sinn. She must like you and your work, Marilyn. Marilyn I think she's just anxious to see Max. She loves childen. Rita Mae Hi, Marilyn. Marilyn Welcome. It's so nice of you to come. Rita Mae Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max. Ellen Hello, Rita Mae. Rita Mae I haven't seen you since the hospital. Ellen I'm Ellen Stewart, Marilyn's mother-in-law. Rita Mae We met at the hospital. Hello. How are you? Ellen I remember. How are you? Rita Mae Oh, and there is Max! Oh! My, how he's grown! A little present for Max. Marilyn Oh, it's beautiful, Rita Mae! You shouldn't have. Rita Mae It's nothing. It's just a little present for Max. Ellen Can I get you some coffee or tea a cold drink, Rita Mae? Rita Mae Oh, nothing, thank you. Ellen Well, I will leave you two to talk. Come on, you big guy. Yes, come on. That's it. Eleln It's nice seeing you. Let me know if you need anything. Rita Mae Thanks, Ellen. Marilyn Thanks, Ellen. Rita Mae OK, Marilyn. You sounded like you've made a decision when you called me. I'm all ears. Marilyn I have made a decision, Rita Mae. I've decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother. Rita Mae I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision. If I had a child as cute as Max, I might do the same thing. Marilyn But I haven't finished telling you the other half of my decision. Rita Mae The other half? Marilyn Yes. I think I can stay at home and take care of Max and continue my career. Rita Mae Sounds interesting. Let me hear it. Marilyn Do you remember our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique? Rita Mae I sure do. Marilyn Why can't I design dresses for you here at home? And make them here. Have the fittings here, too. Rita Mae And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique. Marilyn Exactly. Rita Mae Oh! What kind of dresses would you design? Marilyn I've thought about that for some time. Rita Mae Yes? Marilyn Wedding dresses. Rita Mae Wedding dresses? Brilliant idea! There's a big market today in wedding dresses. Marilyn That's what I thought. Rita Mae I like the idea very much. And if it's successful, we can expand to all kinds dresses. Marilyn That's what I thought. Rita Mae As a matter of fact, I have a custome for your first wedding dress. My niece is getting married, and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her. Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress. That'll be our first one, and then we'll use it to sell others. Marilyn Do you really mean it? Rita Mae I really mean it. It's a simple idea, and it will work. You can certainly design dresses. I know that. And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home. Marilyn I'm so excited! I can't wait to tell Richard! Rita Mae If I had a baby like Max, I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too. You're making the right decisin for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn. Marilyn It all sounds so easy. Rita Mae Now the hard work begins. Marilyn Would you like to see some of my designs that I've been working on? Rita Mae I'd love to . Ooh! Oh, that's wonderful! Ooh... Episode 23 - The Community Center Act I In Act One, Grandpa reads some bad news. A little later, Grandpa's friend comes to visit. Nat is very upset about something. Why is Nat so upset? 67.mp3 Robbie Morning, Grandpa. Is something the matter, Grandpa? Grandpa The editorial in this paper has my friend Nat Baker real upset. Ah! I'll read it to you. \"The old library building on Chestnut Street, which has been vacant for over a year now, was supposed to be made into a community center to serve the senior citizens as well as the younger people of Riverdale.Due to lack of funds for the repainting of the interior of the building and for the furniture needed, the plans for the community center have been postponed indefinitely.\" He's coming over to talk about it. Robbie Is it tat serious a problem, Grandpa? Grandpa It is. Nat's not as lucky as I am, Robbie. He doesn't have any family with hime. He lives alone and depends on places like a community center to be with people- pelple hi own age. Robbie But there's the old community center on Elm Street. Grandpa It's small, and the problem is that it's set up primarily for kids to play. Ping-Pong tables, soda machines, and lots of music. It's too noisy for some older people like Nat. Robbie I never realized that. Grandpa It's hard for some older people to take all that noise. That's why the new community center is a good idea. Part of the building for older people, part of the building for younger people. Robbie I see what you mean. Grandpa That must be Nat. Robbie It could be Alexandra. She's coming over this morning to help me with my math. Alexandra Hi, Robbie. Robbie Hi, Alexandra. Come on in. Do you want something cold to drink? Axexandra I'd love some cola, please. Robbie Cola coming up. I really appreciate you coming over to help with my math. My final exam is next Tuesday. Alexandra You're so good in all your other subjects. I just can't understand why you have so many problems with math. Grandpa Hi, Alexandra. Alexandra Hi, Mr. Stewart. Grandpa I thought that was Nat Baker who rang the front doorbell. Don't let me interrupt you. Robbie No problem, Grandpa. We're just having some cola before getting to tough stuff- math. Alexandra He'll do anything to avoid getting down to math lessons, Mr.Stewart. Grandpa I was the same way. Robbie Really, Grandpa? Grandpa Reall. I didn't like math, I wasn't good at it, and I didn't like studying it. Robbie But you had to be good at math. You graduated from engineering school. Grandpa I was. But not in high school. For some reason, I couldn't get a handle on it. Then, in college. I became good at it. Alexandra Then there's hope for Robbie. Robbie I can't wait. You think I can just skip it now and get to it at college? Alexandra You'll never get to college to find out, Robbie, if you skip it now. Grandpa That must be Nat. Alexandra Sit down, Robbie. Let's get to work. Grandpa I'd like you to meet my friend Nat Baker. This is Alexandra Pappas, and this is my grandson Robbie, whom I think you've met once twice before. Alexandra Nice to meet you, Mr. Baker. Robbie Hi, Mr.Baker. We met before. Nat Where? Robbie In town. At the hardware store. Nat I remember now. Right. Hi. Hello, Alexandra. Grandpa Don't let us keep you from your math tutoring. Robbie. I know you want to get to it. Robbie Stay...stay. Alexandra I told you. He'll use any excuse to avoid math. Nat Did you read the story in the paper, Malcolm? Grandpa I did. Nat It's a serious matter for a lot of us. A serious matter. Grandpa It is. Come on out to the patio. We'll talk about it out there. Nat Thanks. Nice to meet you...again. Alexandra What's the problem? Robbie Come on? You'll hear about it. Act II In Act Two, Nat and Grandpa talk about fixing up the old library. And Robbie and Alexandra offer to help too. So they agree to meet the next day. But the next day ... Where could they be? 68.mp3 Nat There is a way, Malcolm. We get our friends to roll their sleeves up and get to work. Grandpa It's certainly a good idea. If I could take a look at the place, I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up. How much paint, how many hours of work... Nat That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.If you would wupervise the refurbishing, I'll find the people to help do it. Robbie I'll help too, Mr.Baker. I can get some of my friends to go around the neighbrhood and collect the furniture we need. Alexandra I'll help. Grandpa Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here. Robbie Can we help? Alexandra I'd really like to. Grandpa Sure. Nat We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie. Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture, but to help with the paint job. That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us. Robbie I'll do it. I'll talk to them. Alexandra And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan? Grandpa Come in, come in. Please, come in. Nat I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart. Malcolm, this Joanne Thompson Grandpa Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you. Joanne My pleasure, Malcolm. Nat And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe. He ran the drugstore and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends. Grandpa Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe. Abe Hello, Mr. Stewart. Grandpa Malcolm, please. Abe Hello, Malcolm. Grandpa Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee. And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you. Nat Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra? Weren't they going to be here this morning? Grandpa I thought so, too. I'm surprised they're not here. Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra. Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but... Nat It's OK. I'm sure they meant well, but they probably had other things on their minds. Joanne I understand you used to be in the construction business, Malcolm. Grandpa I was, indees. Joanne I wonder if you would take a look at the old library and make sure that it is in good condition so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems. Grandpa When can I do that? I'd be happy to. Abe We've got permission to go inside the old building during the week-Tuesday or Wednesday. Grandpa That's fine with me. I can do it either day. Joanne That would be very helpful. Nat I think the building just needs a good cleaning. Abe And a good paint job. Joanne Then we have to furnish it. Grandpa I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting. They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up. Joanne Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime, let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have. Grandpa OK. Nat Go ahead, Janne. Janne As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning. Nat This place can be developed with one real intergenerational program. Grandpa That's an idea I like. A community center with the kinds of programs that fit everyone. Nat And programs that don't leave anyone out. Joanne It's asking a lot. But we can't do it without talking to the young people. Finding out what they want. Grandpa If only Robbie and Alexandra were here. Nat Don't be upset, Malcolm. We'll have a chance to talk to them later. Grandpa It's not like Robbie. If he says he's going to be here, he's here. I wonder what the problem is. Act III In Act Three, Robbie and Alexandra finally arrive. And they brought someone to help work on the community center project. Maxwell listens to the others and understands what they need to do. But how can he help? 69.mp3 Robbie Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late. But Alexandra and I have been busy at work this morning on the community-center project.And we brought someone along who can help. You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa? He's the editor of the Riverdale paper. He wrote some nice articles on Mom when she was running for the school board. Grandpa Yes, I remember. You were a great help. Maxwell Hi, Mr. Stewart. Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project. From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me, you people are making one big story. Grandpa Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell. This is Nat Baker, who's responsible for this meeting, and this is Joanne Thompson-and Abe Lucas, who used to run the drugstore in town. Maxwell Robbie and Alexandra told me what you need to fix up the old library. I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you. Grandpa Let's go. What are your questions? Maxwell OK. Now, I have...first...a couple of questions here. Have you talked to the community council? And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection? Maxwell OK, what do you need most of all? Grandpa People power. Mem and women, young and old, to give us their time. Maxwell To do what? Joanne To help scrub the building interior clean. Nat So that we can repaint it. Maxwell And you also need bodies to do repainting? Grandpa That's right. And we'll also need some ladders and some brushes and some paint. Maxwell When do you need the volunteers, and where do they report? Grandpa I've got the council to agree to open the building for us on the next four weekends. Maxwell How about furnshings? Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper? Joanne Yes. Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with. Maxwell Let's see. Four desks. Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs. Six table lamps. Three end tables .One piano. This is a good start. These items shouldn't be difficult to come by once I print the article in the paper. This community has always been very generous. Grandpa I agree, Mr. Maxwell. Maxwell What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed, we need to put together volunteers from the various generations of future users. Grandpa That's right. Nat And without their energy and stamina, there's no way we can complete this project. Maxwell I've got it. Now give m some information about how you see the building being used. Joanne Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area... Grandpa It's here, Robbie. Charles Maxwell lived up to his word. \"At the Stewart family home on Linden street yesterday, a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered to plan the refurbishing of the old library to transform it into a new community center. The original plan by the council was tabled because of lack fo funds.The new plan needs you . You could call it a community unity plan. It needs your time, and it needs your energy. And it needs your contributions of fumiture, paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera. A list of these items and a volunteer form can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices. By working together, this community can do anything to benefit its citizens, and we know you will all work together towards refurbishing the old library and making it a new community center. Charles Maxwell, Editor.\" Episode 24 - Parting Friends Act I In Act One, Robbie is thinking about Alexandra and their friendship. Ellen suggests having a special party for Alexandra. And Robbie would like to buy Alexandra a gift. What's the problem? 70.mp3 Robbie Hi, Mom. Ellen Hi, Robbie You're home from school early. Robbie Yeah, they're getting the assembly hall ready for the graduation ceremony, so we all got to go home early. Too noisy to study. Ellen Well, now that you're here, you can help me with dinner. I need those potatoes peeled and sliced. Robbie Mom, give me a break Alexandra's coming over to help me study for my math final. Ellen Well, in that case, you can wash the dishes and clean up after dinner. Robbie Can I invite Alexandra to stay for dinner? Ellen Of course. Robbie Thanks, Mom. Ellen You an Alexandra have become good friends, haven't you? Robbie Yes. I like her.She's a terrific person. I'm going to miss her when she goes back to Greece. Ellen Would you like to give her a little farwell party? Robbie Mom, that would be terrific! Maybe we could make it a surprise. Ellen Oh, I don't know. Surprise parties don't always work out. Robbie Well, we could tell her it's a graduation party for me. When Alexandra arrives, we'll surprise her. Ellen Well, I suppoes that might work. Robbie I'd like to give her a nice going-away present. Ellen Fine. Robbie There's only one problem. Ellen What's that? Robbie I'm broke. I should have saved some money. Ellen I'm sure Alexandra would be happy with something simple, Robbie. Robbie I know. But, well, I'd like to give her something nice to remember me by. Maybe I could borrow some money from you and Dad. Ellen It's all right with me if it's all right with your dad. Robbie Thanks, Mom. I'll talk to him. Is he still in his office? Ellen I think so. Robbie Thanks, Mom. Ellen Robbie! Good luck! Molly Here are the X-rays you wanted , Dr. Stewart. Philip Oh. Thank you, Molly. Now, let me check them. Molly What do you think? Philip I don't see any breaks or fractures. Well, well. Thank you, Molly. Molly Thank you. Philip Come in! Hi, Son. Robbie Hi, Dad. Am I interrupting you? Philip No, no, no, no,. What's up? Robbie Can we talk? Philip Sure. Robbie I need some help. Philip Well, that's what fathers are for. Robbie Well, before I go to college, I have the whole summer... Philip Yes... Robbie And I'm planning to get a job for the summer. Philip And What sort of job? Robbie I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool. Philip Sounds pretty good. Robbie Yes. I'll be earning pretty good money if I get it. But right now, I'm kind of short of cash. Philip Who isn't? Robbie And my friend Alexandra is going to Greece... Philip Nice girl. We'll all miss her. Robbie Mom says we can her a going-away surprise party. Philip Good idea. Robbie And I'd like to get her a nice gift... Philip What'd you have in mind? Robbie Well, a wristwatch, so she'll think of me when she looks at the time. Nothing flashy or expensive. Something simple-but a good one. Philip Sounds fine, Robbie. Robbie Well, I saw a nice watch. But I'll need a loan. If you could lend me the money, I could pay you back out of my lifeguard salary. Philip Well, I guess your mother and I can manage it. When do you need the money? Robbie Would tomorrow be OK? Philip You've got it. Robbie Thanks, Dad. Philip My pleasure, Son. Oh, and, Robbie... Robbie Yes? Philip You'll probably want the family car so you can drive her home after the party. Robbie Could I? Philip If you drive carefully. Robbie I will. Thanks, Dad. Philip My pleasure. Robbie You're OK, Dad. Philip You're not so bad yourself, Son. Act II In Act Two, Robbie invites Alexandra to the party. But he doesn't tell her that the party is for her. It's a surprise.

Are you excited about graduating from high school? Robbie Sure...and a little scared. Alexandra Scared? Why? Robbie Aren't you a little scared? Alexandra I was when I first came to the United States. I'd never been away from home, and I didn't know what it would be like. But then I found out that people are the same everywhere once you get to know them. Robbie I'm glad I got to know you. Alexandra Thatnk you. I'm glad I got to know You-and your family. Robbie Wouldn't it be nice if we could skip the examinations and get right to the graduation party? Alexandra It would be very nice.

But Marilyn doesn't feel comfortable about leaving the baby. Why is Marilyn so concerned about leaving Max? 73.mp3 Richard Hot dogs. I love hot dogs. There is nothing better than a hot dog in the country. Ellen Hot dogs and mustard. Richard Cooked outdoors over an open fire. I wish I had one now. Ellen Do you remember when Daddy and I used to take you and Susan and Robbie to Jones Beach? Richard Oh, I sure do. Ellen We'd wait until dark and make a fire, and we'd cook the hot dogs. Oh, don't forget the mustard. And, oh, does anybody want ketchup? Richard I might as well take it along. And now to make sure we've got the hamburger patties. I have to remember to put them in the bag tomorrow morning before we leave. Ellen I'll remind you, Ricard. Richard Mom, we really appreciate your taking care of Max for the weekend and giving up your free time. Ellen I love doing it. Susan and Harry have a sitter for Michelle in the city, and I'm taking care of Max. It's no big deal. I am happy to do it for you. Richard I guess Max is asleep by now. He's not crying anymore. Ellen Oh, poor baby. He's teething. Marilyn Well, he's asleep-finally. I feel so bad for him. It hurts so much when a baby gets his first teeth. Ellen He'll be fine, Marilyn. Richard Well, he wakes up several times during the night, and the pain is so bad. Marilyn I'm really concerned about going away for the weekend, Ellen, and leaving you with the full responsibility of taking care of Max. Especially with his teething. I wish he felt better. Ellen Please don't worry, Marilyn. Remember your father-in-law's a pediatrician. We have a live-in doctor if there's a problem I can't handle. Richard I agree, Marilyn. We really don't have to be overly concerned. Richard I'll go upstairs and stay with him until he falls asleep again. Marilyn Thanks, Richard. Try putting him across your lap on his stomach.

Marilyn Thanks, honey. I hope he's good when we're away. Richard Well, so do I. Now, to check the list of things we need for the camping trip. We need to bring a flashlight. Ellen It's in the right-hand drawer, next to the bottle openers. Ricard Do we have a bottle opener on the list, Marilyn? Marilyn No.No bottle opener. Is that one of the things Susan and Harry are bringing? Richard No. And we're bring the ketchup, mustard, relish-all that stuff. And cooking utensils. Well, here's the bottle poener, and here's the flashlight. Ellen Matches. Marilyn Matches? Richard Yes, of course. For when we build our campfire. I can't build a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together. Marilyn And don't forget your camera and film, Ricard. Richard All packed and ready. Marilyn And let's not forget our cassette player and some tapes.Some music tapes and some blank tapes so that we can record our thoughts about the trip. Ellen Oh, that's a nice idea. An audio diary.

To be away from the city on such a beautiful day is my idea of heaven! The grass. The trees. The fresh air. Harry I told you you'd like it. I've been doing this for years. Richard You have the spirit of a teenager, Susan. Wait till you see yourself jumping around. Marilyn That's what I love about Susan. She works hard. She plays hard. She's a real Stewart. Harry Come on, Richard. Help me get this stuff out of the car. Richard Where does it go? Harry Well, we'll put everything over there. We'll set up our tents over there by the edge of the woods. Then we'll be able to make our fire there where it's safe. Richard Oh, there's our table and benches. All set for eating. Harry That's what makes this spot so good. Marilyn Is anybody hungry? Susan I am. Harry We just got here. Susan When you're out in the fresh air like this, it makes you hungry. Aren't you hungry, Marilyn? Marilyn I sure am. How about you, Richard? Richard Starving. Harry You guys are like three kids. Richard Aren't you hungry, Harry? Harry Well, yeah. Now that you mention it, I guess I am. I mean, how could a guy not be hungry with all this talk about eating? Marilyn Where's the bag with the chicken salad sandwiches? Harry Right here, next to the ice packs. Here. Put the tablecloth on the picnic table, and I will bring the cola and the plastic cups. Harry Well, how do you like it so far? Richard I've never been more relaxed. Marilyn Me, Neither. Susan I wish we had brought Michelle, Harry. She would have loved it. Marilyn Oh, You're right. I wish we had brought Max. Richard Marilyn, Susan, let's not begin to worry about Michelle and Max. We're having a good time, and they're in good hands. Harry Richard is right. Are you having a good time, Susan? You haven't answered my question. Susan I am having a good time, Harry. I promise not to think about the city. We're in the country. Let's all just enjoy this wonderful place and this wonderful weather. Harry Good. Susan This is heaven, Harry! It was such a great idea to spend the weekend this way. Harry Thanks, Susan. I thought you'd all like it. Susan Like it? I love it! Listen to the sounds of the summer that surround us. It's so calming. Harry I've always liked camping out. Away from the telephones and account books. It's refreshing for me. I always go back to the city in a wonderful state of mind. Susan We've only been here for a day, and I've completely forgotten about all my business problems. The office seems so far away. Harry I'm glad you like it, Susan.We'll spend many more weekends like this. Susan And next time we'll bring Michelle, I wish she were here with us to enjoy the country. Harry And next time we'll bring Michelle. Marilyn Just listen to the sound. It's so soothing. Richard I can hardly keep my eyes open. If only we could bottle the fresh air. Marilyn Wouldn't it be wonderful? Richard We could call it \"Deep Sleep Country Air.\" Marilyn It puts you to sleep. So does the sound. I've bee having a hard time keeping my eyes open just listening to it. It's like a special music. Richard Too bad we can't bottle the sound. Marilyn But we can! Richard Can what? Marilyn Bottle the sound. Richard What are you talking about? Richard Oh, yeah? Great idea! Let's do it! Act III In Act Three, Richard, Marilyn, Harry and Susan return home from their camping trip. Richard thinks that something is the matter. And he tries to solve the problem. Ellen: What works? 75.mp3 Marilyn I'm so glad everyone is asleep. I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be a wake. Richard What did I tell you? Nothing to worry about. Susan I'm sure everything is fine. My mother knows all there is to know about taking care of babies, I assure you. Harry Let's put some of this stuff away and then take off. We've got a forty-minute drive into the city. Ellen Welcome home-and I do mean welcome home. Richard Something wrong? Ellen Oh, nothing's wrong, Richard.Believe me, Max is fine. But his teeth hurt, and he just can't get to sleep, poor dear. Susan Neither can you. Marilyn Oh, I feel so bad. Ellen Oh, I'm fine. How was your weekend? Harry We had a great time, Mom. Richard It was wonderful. The weather couldn't have been better. Ellen It was nice here, too. Marilyn Did you get a chance to get outside at all? Ellen Oh, yes. Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon. I went to the supermarket to get a few things, and I stayed out an extra half hour. The village was filled people-the weather was so nice. Richard Harry's a professional camper, Mom. He knows all there is to know, and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy. Harry Come on. You all helped. Susan You were wonderful, Harry! Marilyn Why don't you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep. Ellen Oh, I'm fine. Tell me more about your weekend. Did you do anything special? Susan Lots of special country things.We picked flowers. Marilyn And we brought some home for you. It was so nice to be out in the country. Ellen They smell wouderful. Marilyn Everything smelled so special. It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells. Harry It would be a great business if you could do that. Ellen Oh! Marilyn Uh, we're home now, Ellen. We'll take care of it. Richard I'll take care of it. Let's see if it works. Ellen What's that? Richard A little we'd better head home. It's getting late, and we have a bit of a drive. Harry Well, all your things are inside. There's your sleeping bag. Marilyn Oh, thanks, Harry. Harry Say good-bye to Richard. We'll call you all tomorrow night. Marilyn Good-bye. Susan Bye, Mom. Ellen Bye-bye. Marilyn Bye. Ellen I'm so tired I think I'm overtired. I don't know if I can get to sleep.

Richard Like Max did. Richard Good night. Marilyn Good night. Sounds of the country. The soothing sounds of the country. Episode 26 - Opening Night Act I In Act One, Richard's publisher is preparing an exhibit, a show with Richard's photographs. Richard is very nervous. Later, a newspaper critic arrives to review Richard's work. Will he like Richard's work? 76.mp3 Carlson A little further to the right, Tom. Tom Is this OK? Carlson Good.What do you think ,Richard? Richard I like it there. Carlson It's the first thing people will see when they come in. It sets the tone for the whole show. The next thing they'll see is this enlargement with the words Family Album, U.S.A. Richard I can't believe this is really happening! Carlson You've earned it. Years of work went into these pictures. Richard I know, but it's still a dream come true. Carlson Well, remember, we're not sure what the critics are going to write about your show yet. And you never know what the man from the New York Times is going to say about it. Richard Are you worried? Carlson I always worry. The reviews of this show are important for the sales of your book. Richard When do we see the reviews? Carlson Soon. One of the critics is coming over this morning for a preview. I hope he's in a good mood. Richard So do I. Marilyn and I hope to use money from the sales of this book to buy a new house. Carlson The book will be a success. And the show will help promote it. Richard Speaking of promoting the book, do I really have to autograph copies for the guests at the opening? Carlson It's common practice. Richard I feel uncomfortable about it. Carlson A lot of people come to openings just so they can get the autograph of somebody who may be famous someday. Richard Couldn't we wait until I'm famous? Carlson A little further back, Tom. It's too close to the refreshments. Richard No, I think this one belongs in the \"people-at-work\" section. Carlson You may be right.Try it there,Tom Tom Right. Carlson Nervous about the opening tonight? Richard Nervous? Me? No.I'm scared to death. Carlson How about guests? How many people will you be bringing? Richard Well, my family, I guess. My wife Marilyn, my father and mother, my brother Robbie, my sister and her husband and their daughter. And my grandfather. Is that too many? Carlson No such thing as\" too many\" at an opening. Richard I hope they like it. Carlson Your family or the pubic? Richard Everybody. But especially my family. They've stood by me throught all this. Carlson I'm sure they'll like it. Mitchell Harvey, how are you? Carlson Mitchell, so nice of you to come. Richard, this is Mitchell Johnson. Mitchell is one of the most important syndicated reviewers in the country. Mitchell Well, you're the young man who did all this. Richard I'm afraid so. Mitchell Nice to meet you. Richard Nict to meet you, Mr. Johnson. Carlson Mitchell has always encouraged new talent. Mitchell Well...you mind if I look around and see what it says to me? Carlson Be our guest. Mitchell Mm-hmm, hmm, uh-huh. Richard What does that mean when he goes, \"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,mm-hmm\"? Carlson It probably means he's clearing his throat. I don't know. Tom I don't care what the critics say, Mr.Stewart. Your work is brilliant. Richard Thank you, Tom. Carlson Tom is studying photography at NYU.He's working with me during the summer months as an intern. Richard Oh, really? I'd like to see your work. Tom It's not good enough to show. I'm still learning. Richard Oh, I'd still like to see your work. You may be the next Ansel Adams and not even know it. Tom If you really mean it, I'll bring some of my pictures into the gallery. Richard I do mean it. Mitchell Very interesting pictures, Mr.Stewart. You have a most unusual eye. Richard Thank you. I hope that's a compliment. Mitchell It is. Carlson Are you going to be reviewing the show, Mitchell? Mitchell Oh, yes. It's definitely worth reviewing. Carlson Favorably? Mitchell Oh, you know I never answer that question, Harvey. I'd like an advance copy of the book, though, so I can study it. Carlson I have an autographed one in my office. Tom, would you give Mr.Johnson the copy of Richard's book on my desk? Tom Just follow me, Mr.Johnson. Mitchell Sure. Richard Do you think he liked my photographs? Carlson We'll know when tonight's papers come out. Keep your fingers crossed. Act II In Act Two, Richard gets ready to go to the opening of his exhibit. He is more nervous now. Richard is worried about what people will think of his work. Later Richard and Marilyn arrive at the gallery. What's wrong? 77.mp3 Marilyn Do you like the dress? Richard I love it. Marilyn I designed it myself. Richard It's beautiful. Marilyn Are you ready? We're supposed to be there before the guests arrive. Richard I know. I know. Help me with this tie, will you? Honey, I'm scared to death. Marilyn But this is what you've been working for all these years. Richard No, no. I worked to put together a book of photographs. This is show business. Marilyn Well, it's all part of the same job. Just relax and enjoy it. Richard You're right. I earned this, and I'm going to enjoy it. As soon as I recover from my nervous breakdown. Marilyn What are you afraid of? Richard Everything. A critic was there this morning. He probably hates my work. I have to sign copies of my book for a lot of people I never met before. My new shoes hurt my feet... Marilyn You're going to be a great success. Are you ready? Richard As soon as I get these cuff links on. Marilyn Let me help. Mom and Dad are already on their way down to the gallery. Marilyn There! You look very attractive. Richard Thank you. Well, I suppose I'v run out of excuses. Marilyn Mm-hmm. Let's go... Richard Oh, one minute. Before we go to the gallery, I just want to tell you that I never could have done this book without your help and your love. I appreciate it. Marilyn Thanks. Now, no more stalling. Marilyn What is it? Richard There's nobody here! Marilyn Of course not, Richard. Your show doesn't begin until eight thirty. Richard Oh. Right. Carlson Richard! Welcome! Good luck tonight! Richard Well, thanks. This is my publisher. Harvey Carlson. You've met my wife Marilyn... Carlson Charmed. Marilyn Hi. Richard My mother, Ellen Stewart. Harvey Carlson. Carlson It's good to meet you.

Carlson Welcome, Mr.Stewart. Well, make yourselves comfortable. There are hors d'oeuvres at the table, fruit punch at the bar. Help yourselves. Can I get you something, Mr.Setwart? Grandpa No, thank you. Carlson You can feel very proud of your grandson, Mr.Stewart. Grandpa I do. I'm proud of all my grandchildren, Mr.Carlson. Carlson Of course.Feel free to look around. If you need anything, just ask. Grandpa Thank you. Richard Harvey? Carlson Yes? Richard Did Mitchell Johnson's review come out yet? Carlson Not yet. The newpapers don't come out till about ten 0'clock. When they come out, we'll get it. Richard Thanks. Carlson Ready? Richard Yes. Have the people arrived? Carlson The guests are waiting. Tom's about to open the doors. Good luck! And stop worrying! They're going to love it. Act III In Act Three, Mr. Carlson gives Richard a newspaper. But Richard is too nervous to read it. It's a review of Richard's work. Later, Mr. Carlson introduces Richard and Marilyn to John O'Neill. Mr. O'Neill is magazine publisher and he offers Richard a job. Will he take the job? 78.mp3 Richard What's this? Carlson Read it. Richard I can't. Would you read it, Marilyn? Marilyn \"Richard Stewart's show at the Carlson Gallery is a collection of photographs from his new book entitled Family Album, U.S.A.There is power and beauty in. Mr.Stewart's work, and his book introduces us to a remarkable new talent.\" Oh, Richard, it's wonderful! Carlson Congratulations! Richard Wow! I'm overwhelmed. Carlson Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention for a moment, please? I hope you're all enjoying the exhibition.I know that I am. And I would like to introduce the young man who spent the last five years taking these remarkable pictures and writing the background for Family. Album, U.S.A-Mr Richard Stewart. Richard Hello. I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight. I'd like to thank Harvey Carlson for his faith in my project. But most of all, I would like to thank my family for their love and support all through this adventure. Thank you. Richard Oh, I'm glad this's over. Tom Would you mind? Richard Oh, not at all. Tom Thanks. Richard Our pleasure. Hope it wins a Pulitzer Prize. Tom I'll settle for an\"A\" in my photography course. Carlson Ah, Richard, Marilyn, I want you to meet John O'Neill. Richard Oh,how do you do ? Marilyn Nict to meet you. O'Nell I've been looking forward to meeting your husband, Mrs. Stewart. I'm really impressed by your show. Richard Thank you. O'Neill In fact, I'd like your autograph. Richard Oh, well, really... O'Neill On a contract. Richard What's this about, Harvey? Carlson Mr.O'Neill is the publisher of several magazines. Marilyn Of course. I've seen you on television. Carlson Mr.O'Neill was so impressed with your work that he wants to develop it into a magazine concept. Richard Well, that sounds very exciting, but where would I fit into the plan? O'Neill I'd like you to be the photo editor of the magazine. Marilyn Oh, Richard, how exciting! Carlson It's a wonderful opportunity, Richard. Richard Hold on. Wait a minute, please. Carlson What's the problem, Richard? Richard The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor. I like what I do. In fact, I love what I do...which is going out with a camera and a roll of film and seeing the wonder of humanity. Now, I appreciate your offer, but I've worked so hard on Family Ablum, U.S.A, and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject. I'm flattered, but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that. Thank you, but I'm happy being a photoprapher. O'Neill I understand, Richard. Carlson Richard, I know your next book will be a success.Congratulations! Richard Thanks. Marilyn You're a real Stewart! Richard Thanks.

Marilyn Well, what do you think about Richard and me looking for a small house or an apartmnt at this point in our lives? Ellen We love having you here, and there is room, and...and when the baby comes, the baby can stay in your room for a while. Marilyn Richard feels we need to find a small house. Ellen I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa. Philip was a young doctor, and he kept talking about having a house of our own. It's natural. Marilyn What did you do ? Ellen We looked at a lot of houses. Marilyn Did you find one? Ellen Oh, not at first. We couldn't afford it.Grandpa wanted to led us the money to buy one, but philip is too independent. He didn't want to borrow any money. Marilyn Sounds like Richard. Ellen They're all alike. Richard is a real Stewart. He's independent, and sometimes just stubbom. Marilyn When did you buy a house? Ellen After Richard was born. I was teaching music,and Philip was opening his first meical office. Marilyn Where was the house? Ellen Right here in Riverdate. Of course, it was a small house, but just right for us. Marilyn It's funny. History repeats itself. Now Richard and I are having a baby, and we prbably won't be able to afford a house right away, either. Ellen Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn? Marilyn Good idea. Ellen Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times. You'll learn a lot. Marilyn Maybe we should speak to a real-estate agent about a house. Ellen And a bank about a mortgage. Marilyn I'll talk to Richard about it. I think it's a good idea, Ellen. We can learn a lot by asking. Ellen And if I can be of any help, let me know. As a matter of fact, my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent. Marilyn Good. Ellen You won't believe this, but she sold us our first house and this one.

Virginia Yes, and you were such a cute baby. Marilyn I've seen pictures of him. He had blond hair.

Richard Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then, and they needed the extra room. Virginia I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs.Stewart. Marilyn Mmm-hmm. So we will be needing more room.

This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range. Marilyn It's pretty, but I prefer a two-story home. Richard I do, too. I don't care for a ranch type. Virginia OK. Oh, this is a wonderful house. I know it well. I sold it to the present owners. Richard It looks wonderful. Virginia This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house. It has a full basement, and it is on a half- acre lot. You can probably afford this one. Marilyn I like this house. Richard So do I. Virginia And the price is right. Would you like to go see it? Richard Yes. We're planning to talk to someone at the bank next week. Perhaps we could see the house this weekend. Virginia If some one doesn't buy it before then. But let's keep looking. Just to get an idea of some other possibillties. Richard This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli. Virginia Here. This is a wounderful example of Spanish-style architecture. Richard Oh, I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house. Marilyn It looks like the houses in Hollywood. Virginia It's interesting. A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price. Oh my! Here's a real buy. It's a bargain. This house just came on the market. Marilyn It's quite lovely. Is it a two-bedroom house? Virginia No. It has three bedrooms and three baths. I know the house. It has a brand new kitchen. And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. And there's a two-car garage. Richard Then why don't we go look at this house, too? Virginia It's a good investment. Richard Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli. Marilyn Thanks so much. Virginia My pleasure. Give my best to your parents. Virginia Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard.

Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment? Richard Yes, we are. Mr.Riley Payments over thirty years? Richard Yes. Marilyn Do you think we can get a loan? Mr.Riley Well, it depends. Do you own any other property? Any stocks or bonds? Richard No. Mr.Riley I see. Then you don't have any collateral. Perhaps you could get a guarantor- someone to sign for the loan for you. Richard Why is that necessary? Mr.Riley Since you don't have enough income, and you don't already own any property, the bank needs to be sure you can pay the mortgage every month. A gauarntor is responsible for the loan if you can't make the payments. Richard I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting. Marilyn Thank you, Mr.Riley. We'll read this over carefully. Mr.Riley Thank you. Richard Good-bye. Thanks. Mr.Riley Godd-bye.And hope to see you soon. Richard I hope so, too. Mr.Riley Take care. Marilyn Good-bye.

I don't feel right about it. Marilyn I understand your feelings about it, Richard. Ellen Now, tell me, what's the problem? Marilyn We can get a loan from the bank if we can put up some collateral. Richard And we don't own anything to use as collateral. Marilyn Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor. Ellen Why don't you speak to Dad? Richard No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone. Ellen Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard. Marilyn I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen. Richard In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book and be able to put more money down. Marilyn What about the house in Mount Kisco? Somebody else'll buy it by then.

Marchetta Let's talk business. Grandpa That's music to my ears. Marchetta I understand you used to be in the construction business. Grandpa Yup. Forty-three years. Here's a brief description of forty three years of on-the-job training. Marchetta That is some history! You're a valuable asset, Malcolm.Very valuable. Grandpa Thank you. Yup. Forty-three years. Half that time in my own construction company. Big jobs-factories, shopping malls.That kind of thing. Marchetta Then you retired. Grandpa Yes. After my wife died, and I felt I should spend more time with my children and grandchildren. I live in Florida, and they lived in New York. Marchetta I understand.My daughter Cami lives in NewYork. I like being near her. Grandpa When I came here, I planned to take a few months off. Relax with the family and then look for some work. Put my experience on the line...but, unfortunately, there isn't any work for a retired person my age. Marchetta Sometimes there is, and sometimes there isn't. Well, I'm mvolved with an organization, and we're trying to resolve that problem. Grandpa What's that? Marchetta TOPS.T -O-P-S- means Talented Older People's Society. Grandpa I'd like to be a member. How much are the dues? Marchetta There are no dues...The organization serves major men and women like you. Experienced, talented, retired.But our members want to go out there and use their talents.They want to work. Grandpa That fantastic, John! Marchetta I've got and idea for you, Malcolm. Just fill out this form for me. It'll only take a few minutes. Sit right here, and do it while I talk to my secretary. When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory. My company is a membe of TOPS. So I try hard to find opportunities for people like it. Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now. Have you got time this morning to go over to the construction site with me? I'd like to have you meet my foreman-get some background on the job. Grandpa I've got plenty of time. Marchetta I'll be right back. We'll go over to the job site together. Danny Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project? Grandpa My company was the contractor. I built the theater there with my own two hands, practically. Danny I understand. Marchrtta Well, I'm glad to see you two guys geeting along so well because Danny, Malcolm is on the TOPS team.He's going to be working with you for a while. His experience will be valuable to both of us. Danny Welcome aboard, Malcolm! Marchetta I'm going back to my office. Give me a call later, Malcolm. I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting. I'd like you to meet the group. Grandpa I will, John. And again-thanks. Marchetta No...thank you. And thank Susan. Grandpa He's quite a man. Danny A real inspiration for me. Grandpa OK, Danny. I know you didn't expect to have me around, but I think I can be of some help to you. Danny Let me tell you something, Malcolm. With your background and experience, I can learn something...and I do need some advice on a difficult problem.Let me show you this. Grandpa I don't want to give you a final opinion without studying these building plans more carefully. But a simple solution might be to move the air-conditioning units instead of redesigning the entire system. It might be simpler and less expensive. Danny You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm. Welcome aboard! Grandpa It all happended so quickly! I can't believe it! Susan I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful. Grandpa He was more than helpful. He actually took me to meet his foreman. Susan I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa. Grandpa I don't know how to thank you, Susan.You're a wonderful granddaughter. Susan It's good to see you so happy. Grandpa I'll be at the construction site tomorrow. What are you doing tomorrow night? Susan I'm not doing anything. Why? Grandpa How about a date with your grandfather? I owe you a good steak dinner.

Harry No, NO, Robbie doesn't have them. He gave them to me to hold on to them because he didn't want the responsibility of holding them. I put them in my tuxedo but in the lapel pocket. That's a relet. I was really worried. Richard I'll hold on to them for you. The best man always keeps the rings. Harry You're right. You're right. You hold on to them so there won't be problem later.

I held him closely. I kissed the top of his dear little head. He looked up at me. He tried to smile. Being with him helped. Ellen Helped him? Or helped you? Marilyn Being a mother is not easy, if that's what you mean. Ellen Speaking of being a mother, I've been meaning to ask you what you were thinking about regarding going back to work. I know Rita Mae called. I can imagine what is going through your head. Marilyn I'm sure you can, Ellen. Ellen There are so many things to consider. One thing that makes it easier for you is that you have us. Max will always have a family member to watch over him while you're at work. I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born. Marilyn What did you do? Ellen I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher. We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan, and I continued with my career. Marilyn Do you think you made the right decision? Ellen I think I did. But when Ribbie was born, I decided to give fulltime attention to raising Robbie. I felt differently at that time. Marilyn And you gave up your career as a music teacher? Ellen Not exactly. I continued to teach piano lessons at home. Marilyn How did you feel about being away when Susan and Ricard were babies? Ellen I think I did the right thing for them and for myself and for Philip. We needed the money. Remember? Marilyn Well, we do too, Ellen. Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house we want and need. Susan I can't wait till he's just a little older. Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids. Marilyn Max thanks you. I thank you. And Ricard thanks you. Now may I please say hello? Susan Hello. Hello. I miss Max and think about him all week long. We talk about him at dinner time. Ellen Will you please try to relax? I've never seen you so wound up. Marilyn You seem to be enjoying the pressure. Susan The truth is, I am. My job is not an easy one, but I really enjoy it. Marilyn That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan. Susan What's the problem? Ellen Marilyn's career. Marilyn Well, my choice of careers. Susan Choice? Marilyn My career as a fashion desinger versus my career as a mother. Susan Why does it have to be one or the other? Ellen That's what I said. Marilyn How's that? Susan Why can't you do both? Ellen She's right. Marilyn Both? Susan Well, that's what I do. I have a job, and I have Michelle. I take care of both to the best of my ability. It's not easy, but what is? Ellen And that's what I did. I did both with Richard and Susan, and I did both with Robbie. Marilyn I thought you stayed home with Robbie? Ellen I did. But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher which I could continue at home. Susan Why can't you work at home, Marilyn? You're very talented. Designing dresses is a career you could establish out of your home, couldn't you? Marilyn I don't know why I didn't think of it. It seems so simple now.for a year or two I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs. Ellen And you could make your dresses at home. Susan Sounds like a great way to solve the problem. Ellen That could solve your problem, Marilyn. Marilyn I'm going to call rita Mae at home and ask her come by and talk about it. She want to see Max, anyway. Susan I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn. You can do it.Do your designs at home-here. Marilyn And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique. Ellen And you can both benefit financially. Marilyn I'm going to call Rita Mae right now. Oh, Susan, thank you so much for coming all this way form the city to talk to me about it. I hope you don't mind having taken so much time away from your busy schedue. Susan Are you kidding? I don't mind at all. As a matter of fact, I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew. Ellen I think you should call Rita Mae right now. I think your idea of working at home is perfect. Marilyn I don't know what I would do without you. I'm lucky to have you all. Ellen We are lucky to have you, Marilyn. Susan And so is Max.","title":"Act II"},{"location":"110_english/family_album_usa/family_album_usa_summary/#act-iii_21","text":"In the third act, Marilyn tells Rita Mae about her decision to stay at home with Max.

If I had a child as cute as Max, I might do the same thing. Marilyn But I haven't finished telling you the other half of my decision. Rita Mae The other half? Marilyn Yes. I think I can stay at home and take care of Max and continue my career. Rita Mae Sounds interesting. Let me hear it. Marilyn Do you remember our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique? Rita Mae I sure do. Marilyn Why can't I design dresses for you here at home? And make them here. Have the fittings here, too. Rita Mae And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique. Marilyn Exactly. Rita Mae Oh! What kind of dresses would you design? Marilyn I've thought about that for some time. Rita Mae Yes? Marilyn Wedding dresses. Rita Mae Wedding dresses? Brilliant idea! There's a big market today in wedding dresses. Marilyn That's what I thought. Rita Mae I like the idea very much. And if it's successful, we can expand to all kinds dresses. Marilyn That's what I thought. Rita Mae As a matter of fact, I have a custome for your first wedding dress. My niece is getting married, and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her. Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress. That'll be our first one, and then we'll use it to sell others. Marilyn Do you really mean it? Rita Mae I really mean it. It's a simple idea, and it will work. You can certainly design dresses. I know that. And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home. Marilyn I'm so excited! I can't wait to tell Richard! Rita Mae If I had a baby like Max, I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too. You're making the right decisin for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn. Marilyn It all sounds so easy.

A little later, Grandpa's friend comes to visit. Nat is very upset about something. Why is Nat so upset? 67.mp3 Robbie Morning, Grandpa. Is something the matter, Grandpa? Grandpa The editorial in this paper has my friend Nat Baker real upset. Ah! I'll read it to you. \"The old library building on Chestnut Street, which has been vacant for over a year now, was supposed to be made into a community center to serve the senior citizens as well as the younger people of Riverdale.Due to lack of funds for the repainting of the interior of the building and for the furniture needed, the plans for the community center have been postponed indefinitely.\" He's coming over to talk about it. Robbie Is it tat serious a problem, Grandpa? Grandpa It is. Nat's not as lucky as I am, Robbie. He doesn't have any family with hime. He lives alone and depends on places like a community center to be with people- pelple hi own age. Robbie But there's the old community center on Elm Street. Grandpa It's small, and the problem is that it's set up primarily for kids to play. Ping-Pong tables, soda machines, and lots of music. It's too noisy for some older people like Nat. Robbie I never realized that. Grandpa It's hard for some older people to take all that noise. That's why the new community center is a good idea. Part of the building for older people, part of the building for younger people. Robbie I see what you mean. Grandpa That must be Nat. Robbie It could be Alexandra. She's coming over this morning to help me with my math. Alexandra Hi, Robbie. Robbie Hi, Alexandra. Come on in. Do you want something cold to drink? Axexandra I'd love some cola, please. Robbie Cola coming up. I really appreciate you coming over to help with my math. My final exam is next Tuesday. Alexandra You're so good in all your other subjects. I just can't understand why you have so many problems with math. Grandpa Hi, Alexandra. Alexandra Hi, Mr. Stewart. Grandpa I thought that was Nat Baker who rang the front doorbell. Don't let me interrupt you. Robbie No problem, Grandpa. We're just having some cola before getting to tough stuff- math. Alexandra He'll do anything to avoid getting down to math lessons, Mr.Stewart. Grandpa I was the same way. Robbie Really, Grandpa? Grandpa Reall. I didn't like math, I wasn't good at it, and I didn't like studying it. Robbie But you had to be good at math. You graduated from engineering school. Grandpa I was. But not in high school. For some reason, I couldn't get a handle on it. Then, in college. I became good at it. Alexandra Then there's hope for Robbie. Robbie I can't wait. You think I can just skip it now and get to it at college? Alexandra You'll never get to college to find out, Robbie, if you skip it now. Grandpa That must be Nat. Alexandra Sit down, Robbie. Let's get to work. Grandpa I'd like you to meet my friend Nat Baker. This is Alexandra Pappas, and this is my grandson Robbie, whom I think you've met once twice before. Alexandra Nice to meet you, Mr. Baker. Robbie Hi, Mr.Baker. We met before. Nat Where? Robbie In town. At the hardware store. Nat I remember now. Right. Hi. Hello, Alexandra. Grandpa Don't let us keep you from your math tutoring. Robbie. I know you want to get to it. Robbie Stay...stay. Alexandra I told you. He'll use any excuse to avoid math. Nat Did you read the story in the paper, Malcolm? Grandpa I did. Nat It's a serious matter for a lot of us.

How much paint, how many hours of work... Nat That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.If you would wupervise the refurbishing, I'll find the people to help do it. Robbie I'll help too, Mr.Baker. I can get some of my friends to go around the neighbrhood and collect the furniture we need. Alexandra I'll help. Grandpa Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here. Robbie Can we help? Alexandra I'd really like to. Grandpa Sure. Nat We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie. Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture, but to help with the paint job. That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us. Robbie I'll do it. I'll talk to them. Alexandra And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan? Grandpa Come in, come in. Please, come in. Nat I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart. Malcolm, this Joanne Thompson Grandpa Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you. Joanne My pleasure, Malcolm. Nat And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe.

Grandpa Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee. And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you. Nat Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra? Weren't they going to be here this morning? Grandpa I thought so, too. I'm surprised they're not here. Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra. Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but... Nat It's OK. I'm sure they meant well, but they probably had other things on their minds. Joanne I understand you used to be in the construction business, Malcolm. Grandpa I was, indees. Joanne I wonder if you would take a look at the old library and make sure that it is in good condition so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems. Grandpa When can I do that? I'd be happy to. Abe We've got permission to go inside the old building during the week-Tuesday or Wednesday. Grandpa That's fine with me. I can do it either day. Joanne That would be very helpful. Nat I think the building just needs a good cleaning. Abe And a good paint job. Joanne Then we have to furnish it. Grandpa I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting. They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up. Joanne Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime, let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have. Grandpa OK. Nat Go ahead, Janne. Janne As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning. Nat This place can be developed with one real intergenerational program. Grandpa That's an idea I like. A community center with the kinds of programs that fit everyone. Nat And programs that don't leave anyone out. Joanne It's asking a lot. But we can't do it without talking to the young people. Finding out what they want. Grandpa If only Robbie and Alexandra were here. Nat Don't be upset, Malcolm. We'll have a chance to talk to them later. Grandpa It's not like Robbie.

This is Nat Baker, who's responsible for this meeting, and this is Joanne Thompson-and Abe Lucas, who used to run the drugstore in town. Maxwell Robbie and Alexandra told me what you need to fix up the old library. I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you. Grandpa Let's go. What are your questions? Maxwell OK. Now, I have...first...a couple of questions here. Have you talked to the community council? And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection? Maxwell OK, what do you need most of all? Grandpa People power. Mem and women, young and old, to give us their time. Maxwell To do what? Joanne To help scrub the building interior clean. Nat So that we can repaint it. Maxwell And you also need bodies to do repainting? Grandpa That's right. And we'll also need some ladders and some brushes and some paint. Maxwell When do you need the volunteers, and where do they report? Grandpa I've got the council to agree to open the building for us on the next four weekends. Maxwell How about furnshings? Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper? Joanne Yes. Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with. Maxwell Let's see. Four desks. Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs. Six table lamps. Three end tables .One piano. This is a good start. These items shouldn't be difficult to come by once I print the article in the paper. This community has always been very generous. Grandpa I agree, Mr. Maxwell. Maxwell What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed, we need to put together volunteers from the various generations of future users. Grandpa That's right. Nat And without their energy and stamina, there's no way we can complete this project. Maxwell I've got it. Now give m some information about how you see the building being used. Joanne Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area... Grandpa It's here, Robbie. Charles Maxwell lived up to his word. \"At the Stewart family home on Linden street yesterday, a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered to plan the refurbishing of the old library to transform it into a new community center. The original plan by the council was tabled because of lack fo funds.The new plan needs you . You could call it a community unity plan. It needs your time, and it needs your energy. And it needs your contributions of fumiture, paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera. A list of these items and a volunteer form can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices. By working together, this community can do anything to benefit its citizens, and we know you will all work together towards refurbishing the old library and making it a new community center.

Marilyn And let's not forget our cassette player and some tapes.Some music tapes and some blank tapes so that we can record our thoughts about the trip. Ellen Oh, that's a nice idea. An audio diary.

Carlson Good.What do you think ,Richard? Richard I like it there. Carlson It's the first thing people will see when they come in. It sets the tone for the whole show. The next thing they'll see is this enlargement with the words Family Album, U.S.A. Richard I can't believe this is really happening! Carlson You've earned it. Years of work went into these pictures. Richard I know, but it's still a dream come true. Carlson Well, remember, we're not sure what the critics are going to write about your show yet. And you never know what the man from the New York Times is going to say about it. Richard Are you worried? Carlson I always worry. The reviews of this show are important for the sales of your book. Richard When do we see the reviews? Carlson Soon. One of the critics is coming over this morning for a preview. I hope he's in a good mood. Richard So do I. Marilyn and I hope to use money from the sales of this book to buy a new house. Carlson The book will be a success. And the show will help promote it. Richard Speaking of promoting the book, do I really have to autograph copies for the guests at the opening? Carlson It's common practice. Richard I feel uncomfortable about it. Carlson A lot of people come to openings just so they can get the autograph of somebody who may be famous someday. Richard Couldn't we wait until I'm famous? Carlson A little further back, Tom. It's too close to the refreshments. Richard No, I think this one belongs in the \"people-at-work\" section. Carlson You may be right.Try it there,Tom Tom Right. Carlson Nervous about the opening tonight? Richard Nervous? Me? No.I'm scared to death. Carlson How about guests? How many people will you be bringing? Richard Well, my family, I guess.

Carlson It probably means he's clearing his throat. I don't know. Tom I don't care what the critics say, Mr.Stewart. Your work is brilliant. Richard Thank you, Tom. Carlson Tom is studying photography at NYU.He's working with me during the summer months as an intern. Richard Oh, really? I'd like to see your work. Tom It's not good enough to show. I'm still learning. Richard Oh, I'd still like to see your work. You may be the next Ansel Adams and not even know it. Tom If you really mean it, I'll bring some of my pictures into the gallery.
