Basic C++ Programming In this chapter, we evolve a small program to exercise the fundamental components of the C++ language, These components consist of the following: A small set of data types: Boolean, character, integer, and floating point. A set of arithmetic, relational, and logical operators to manipulate these types. These include not only the usual suspects, such as addition, equality, less than and assignment, but also the less conventional increment, conditional and compound assignment operators. A set of conditional branch and looping statements, such as the if statement and while loop, to alter the control flow of our program. A small number of compound types, such as a pointer and an array. These allow us, respectively, to refer indirectly to an existing object and to define a collection of elements of a single type. A standard library of common programming abstractions, such as a string and a vector. 1.1 How to Write a C++ Program We start in the same place every C++ program starts - in a function called main(). main() is a user-implemented function of the following general form: int main() { // our program code goes here } Chapter 2.
