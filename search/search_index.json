These include not only the usual suspects, such as addition, equality, less than and assignment, but also the less conventional increment, conditional and compound assignment operators. A set of conditional branch and looping statements, such as the if statement and while loop, to alter the control flow of our program.

A standard library of common programming abstractions, such as a string and a vector. 1.1 How to Write a C++ Program We start in the same place every C++ program starts - in a function called main(). main() is a user-implemented function of the following general form: int main() { // our program code goes here } Chapter 2.
